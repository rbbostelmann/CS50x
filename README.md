#### General comments:<br>
I was extremely surprised by how much effort some people put into their scratch projects, be it for the CS50x course or not, like the fully playable Sonic game. That was insane, and I don't think that I, at this point, have enough patience (or ability) to work on something like that. My first choice was to make a quick interactive bear identification guide, showing the key differences between grizzly bears and black bears, and then have the user try and identify a couple of different pictures.  
<br>
That seems to have been a bit beyond what I could do with my limited Scratch knowledge and I would have to spend more time than I had available to make something at that level. My second choice, and the one I actually ended up making, was to make a clip for a song, as some of the examples encouraged us to. My song of choice was "Bare necessities", from Disney's The Jungle Book. It wasn't the most time-intensive project I ever worked on but it was still challenging.<br>
#### Main challenges:<br>
<p>This problem set was particularly hard due to my lack of creativity. I spent more time trying to find something I was interested in building than actually coding - which was surprisingly straightforward. I wanted to implement more movement and have the bear wave its arms up and down, turn its head, walk, etc, but that would require me to redraw multiple parts of the sprite and make all of the graphic changes before even being able to write the code. I tried to do that with the default asset, and while the code worked just fine the animation was atrocious, so I deleted that and went with the basics.  
<br>  
<br>
As for the code itself, once I started to build the blocks and see how they interacted with each other things became much simpler, though it took me some time to figure out how to fuse some blocks to make more elaborated if...else conditionals. That is definitely something I want to work on more if/when I ever decide to come back to Scratch!</p>
